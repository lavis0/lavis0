### 👨🏻‍💻 [Joshua Banga](https://folient.com/)

Hi 👋, 
I'm Josh and I'm currently working on [Syncade](https://syncade.co.uk), which makes it easier for lawyers to handle less formal communication in CRMs! It's landing page and dashboard is build in TypeScript via. Next.js and its backend is running on an Ubuntu server with Docker containerised services, all communicating through REST APIs.

I enjoy writing code in Python and C++ the most, but often interact with C, Go, JavaScript and TypeScript. In Python, I've explored: data analystics libraires and workflows, including pandas, numpy, Tensorflow and PyTorch; GUI design through PyQt and Pygame.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Syncade and an AWS Cloud Practicioner cert. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning operating systems secuirty, systems design and functional programming.
